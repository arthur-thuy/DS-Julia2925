The problem is that daisy does not know how many seeds to buy. However, she is an experienced gardener and only needs to know an estimation of the surface area that needs sowing.

### 2. Overlap

Crisis! Daisy realises that the shapes she has drawn are overlapping and the previous estimation of the number of seeds is too high. Can you quickly assess the severity of this overestimation by counting the number of overlapping patches?

> Some of the fields might overlap. Can you extend the function `isdisjoint` to check if two of your shapes *don't* overlap? How many of the shapes don't overlap?
> 
> **Optional:** count the number of shapes that lie *completely* in another shape.

### 4. Total area within bound

> As you have seen in the previous question, some fields overlap. Likewise, part of the shapes might be out bounds of the $[0,100]\times [0,100]$ larger field. Can you compute or estimate the total available area where you don't count overlapping parts multiple times?
> 
> Computing this exactly might be a bit tricky. So Daisy proposes an alternative solution to estimate the area. She suggests randomly throwing a large number (say, 100,000) of seeds in the big field and counting which fraction land in one of the shapes. This fraction is proportional to the part of the land covered by a field.
> 
> To this end, extend the function `in` such that you can check whether a point lies in one of the shapes, i.e. `(x, y) in shape`. You can use the function `count` to estimate the surface.

	# Project 2: Fluky fields üå±
	
	As a new year's resolution, Daisy would like to [soften her driveway](https://omgeving.vlaanderen.be/nl/vlaanderen-breekt-uit-homepagina) and grow a fantastical front garden. As a founding member of the [anti-lawn movement](https://www.homesandgardens.com/gardens/what-is-the-anti-lawn-movement), Daisy is not a fan of perfectly mown lawns and wants to try something new, *fluky fields*! The idea is so simple yet genius, generate some random geometric shapes and sow accordingly. 
	
	![Dall-E's interpretation of the fluky fields](https://i.imgur.com/IHtBv9e.png)
	
	In this synthesis exercise, you will help Daisy manage her fields. The $n fields are of peculiar shapes: they are all in the shape of $(shape_type)! These little fields are part of a big piece of land that extends from 0 to 100 in both the x- and y-direction.
	
	> **Note:** you can choose the flavour of this exercise by picking the shapes of the fields, `circles` and `rectangles` are pretty easy, while `triangles` will put your geometry skills to the test!
